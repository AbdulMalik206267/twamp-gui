{"name":"Twamp-gui","tagline":"Cross platform twamp client and responder with Qt QML backend","body":"## Twamp\r\nTwo-Way Active Measurement Protocol (TWAMP) provides standard way to make two way delay, availability and jitter tests between two nodes.\r\n\r\nBefore TWAMP, there are proprietary solutions to make these type of tests. Because of the there is no standard about how test flow must be done, you need to use same product or software both of the nodes.\r\n\r\nAfter TWAMP, it is possible to make tests between vendors and products. Most of the network routers and switches start to support TWAMP internally so it is possible to make tests against the those network devices without a need to put a custom probe.\r\n\r\n## Twamp Gui Tools\r\nTWAMP is relatively new protocol and there is not much tools around it. I tried to implement a reference for both of the Twamp Client and Responder which you can clone the repository from:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ git clone https://github.com/demirten/twamp-gui.git\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Cross Platform\r\nI tried to make twamp gui runs natively on Linux, Windows and MacOSX platforms so Qt5 and QML technologies used to achieve this. You can build the executables from the codes if you have a running Qt5 development setup for your system. It is also possible to download prebuilt binaries for your platform.\r\n\r\n## Downloads\r\n### Debian Package\r\n\r\n### Windows Installer\r\n\r\n### MacOSX Installer\r\n\r\n## Screenshots\r\n\r\n## Authors and Contributors\r\nTwamp Gui Tools written by the Murat Demirten (@demirten).\r\n\r\n## Support / Contact\r\nIf you found a bug you can send email to mdemirten@yh.com.tr with tcpdump capture attached or create an issue on https://github.com/demirten/twamp-gui/issues\r\n\r\nYou can also get professional support from us for your TWAMP test network.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
